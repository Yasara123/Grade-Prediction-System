the lecturer to improve the grades of the students at the final exam using <b>Hidden Markov Model and 3 regression methods</b> which are:
<b><br>1.Polynomial Regression<br>2.Exponential Weighted Average Regression <br>3.Exponential Moving Average Regression</b> <br>by combining using<b>Weighted Regression</b>. This article shows the final output of the system and how they are compatible with real results using unit testing.
