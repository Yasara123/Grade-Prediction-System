# Grade-Prediction-System
Here I describe system of analyzing the students marks in several weeks in semester and method of comparing them with other students and system of predicting the future result based on previous years. The aim of this system is to
the lecturer to improve the grades of the students at the final exam using <b>Hidden Markov Model and 3 regression methods</b> which are Polynomial Regression, Exponential Weighted Average Regression and Exponential Moving Average Regression by combining using Weighted Regression. This article shows the final output of the system and how they are compatible with real results using unit testing.
